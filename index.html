<!--
	THIS IS A WEB APP.
	Web apps are made up of THREE main elements (there are a few more, but here we will be using what are referred to as the 'big three')

	1) HTML - The Skeleton of the page, this is where all the text is typed and the images are inserted. Using only html, you can 'hardcode' the elements in a website. This is useful for putting simple, unformatted text and images on the web.

	2) CSS - The Styling of the page, This will be where all the colors and the fonts will be added. In the CSS of a page (usually in a separate file) the styles of all the elements will be be stored.


<!--If you are still confused, here's how Mitesh simplifies it...
	Think of web development like Ice cream :
	Ice cream's Physical Appeareance (Shape): Is just like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
	Icecream's Physical Attributes: Lke Color, Texture, Design, is just like CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
	Icecream's Toppings, side orders, and how you will react to this ice cream is just like Javascript (JS) -->

		<!-- Lines 15-21: We often use different resources to help our applications function better. But how do we get them to work in our project? First we must link them to our project. It is important to link files you want to use in your project otherwise, the functions you are looking for in these files, won't be implemented! Commonly used libraries (aka Resources) usually end up being JS and CSS files.


		TL;DR - To add functionality and ability to our web applications, we will usually include various Script (JavaScript) and CSS (Stylesheet) files, the former helps us add user interactivity while the latter allows us to change the look of our app extensively.
